# Handling-Non-Linearly-Separable-Data
Classification of Non-Linearly Separable Data

The above Code is used to classify two classes that share a non-linear boundary.

This can be accomplished by projecting data to Higher-Dimension. An additional axes is added to the existing data which creates a plane that separates data.

But all of this can be computationally expensive when dealing with Large Datasets. At this time, Kernels come as saviours.

Code also implements Different types of Kernels including,
- Linear Kernel
- Polynomial Kernel
- RBF (Radial Basis Function) Kernel
- Sigmoid Kernel
- and, a custom Kernel

To run the code, please make sure that the latest version of Python, Jupyter and aforementioned libraries are installed in your system.
